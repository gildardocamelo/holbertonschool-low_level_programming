`n` `and then print whether the number stored in variable` `n` `is` `positive`
`or` `negative.`
* 1-last_digit.c `Program that assigns a random number to variable` `n` `and
then print the` `last digit` `of the number stored in variable` `n.`
* 2-print_alphabet.c `Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.`
* 3-print_alphabets.c `Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then
in uppercase.`
* 4-print_alphabt.c `Program that prints the lowercase alphabet omitting the
letter` `q` `and` `e.`
* 5-print_numbers.c `Program that prints all single digit numbers of` `base 10`
`starting from` `0.`
* 6-print_numberz.c `Program that prints all` `base 10` `single digit numbers
starting from` `0` `but only with the` `putchar method.`
* 7-print_tebahpla.c `Program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse.`
* 8-print_base16.c `Program that prints all the numbers of` `base 16` `in
